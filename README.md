Sweets MVC framework.

This is a really lightweight framework, but it is still very flexible and very easy to extend.

The strength of the Sweets is through its actions and controller, which can create a page with no more than 4 lines of code!

The actions are also usable in ajax functions!

It includes hashing for: passwords, cookies, sessions and forms.

It uses templates and new designs can be added very easily through its easy to use template system.

It uses modules to extend backend/server-side functionality.

It uses plugins for frontend/client-side functionality.

It supports different languages, with Danish, English and German as standard languages, more can be added.

Sweets is in general covered by GNU license, those extensions and modules found in the contribution and module folder can be covered by other license schemes.
